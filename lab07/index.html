    <h2>Personal Info</h2>

    <p>Outside of work, I love reading sports articles and watching sports documentaries. In my spare time, I write for The Daily Orange, SU’s student-run paper where I currently cover women’s lacrosse and covered rowing and volleyball in the past. I am big sports fan with my favorite professional teams being the Carolina Panthers and Charlotte Hornets since I am from Charlotte, North Carolina. Raised there pretty much my entire life, I also have two older siblings work in finance or engineering. It’s funny because I am not a fan of reading fictitious novels and I always dreaded English classes in high school simply because they don’t teach journalistic principles. Lastly, for entertainment, my favorite television show is “The Blacklist”. </p>
