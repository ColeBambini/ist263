    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>Hello! Thank you for visiting my web portfolio that consists of some of my multimedia work, though mostly focusing on print and online journalism pieces. In addition, I created this website myself (even the coding behind it) and I hope you enjoy. Feel free to check out the other webpages to view some samples of my work or continue to read below to read of my background, education, and experiences.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>From Charlotte, North Carolina originally, I am an aspiring bilingual sports journalist with significant reporting experience, interviewing anyone from high-school athletes to collegiate athletes to Olympians. Though I have some experience with video production, I best thrive in sports writing on print, digital, and online platforms with many bylines for The Daily Orange, The Princeton Review's 2020 top college newspaper. As a dual-major and double minor student at Syracuse University, I’m developing a vast skillset not just in journalism but also in information technology, sport management, and Spanish literature and culture.</p>

    <p>Besides my passion for sports and journalism, I love to travel, hoping to have that aspect in my future career as a beat writer for a sports team. I’ve traveled to Peru, Saint Lucia and many other cool places within the United States. In summer 2021, I spent my time studying abroad at Syracuse University at Madrid, Spain, enriching my knowledge of the language while immersing myself in a new culture</p>

    <h5>Highlights from Spain!</h5>
